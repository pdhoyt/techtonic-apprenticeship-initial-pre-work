**Introduction to HTML5 ElementsPassed**
- 11/20/19 - No concerns - would be interesting to research 
  how SEO's use <MAIN> to optimize search results.  Topic for
  another day!

**Add Images to Your Website**
- 11/20/19 - No concerns.  Is it generally better to host the
  image files vs. using URLs to external images, from a performace
  perspective?

**Link to External Pages with Anchor Elements**
-11/20/19 - No questions or concerns

**Link to Internal Sections of a Page with Anchor Elements**
- 11/20/19 - New material to me, using an ID to point to
  another place in the same document.

**Nest an Anchor Element within a Paragraph**
- 11/20/19 - Good reminder regarding target=_blank attribute,
  to open the linked URL in a new tab.  Wondering if that 
  works with an internal section link?  No sure if there's 
  a valid use case, but worth experimenting with.

**Make Dead Links Using the Hash Symbol**
- 11/20/19 - Interested in the comment "This is also handy when 
  you're changing the behavior of a link using JavaScript, which 
  we'll learn about later."  I've taken some preliminary Java-
  Script training and haven't run accross where href="#" is
  used.

**Turn an Image into a Link**
- 11/20/19 - Is this still common? 
  Seems like images aren't really used for links anymore.

**Create a Bulleted Unordered List**
- 11/20/19 - No questions or comments.

**Create an Ordered List**
- 11/20/19 - No questions or comments.

**Create a Text Field**

**Add Placeholder Text to a Text Field**
- 11/20/19 - No questions or comments.

**Create a Form Element**
- 11/20/19 - No questions - forms get trickier when
  you have to create routes and interact with databases.  Still
  learning that piece.

**Add a Submit Button to a Form**
- 11/20/19 - No questions.  Input type=submit creates a 
  button as well.  Need to refresh my memory on how they
  differ.

**Use HTML5 to Require a Field**
-  11/20/19 - No questions or comments.

**Create a Set of Radio Buttons** 
- 11/20/19 - No questions or comments.

**Create a Set of Checkboxes**
- 11/20/19 - No questions or comments.

**Use the value attribute with Radio Buttons and Checkboxes**
- 11/20/19 - Great information on the 'Value' attribute, and 
  why it needs to be set on all form items, so the default value
  is not sent.

**Check Radio Buttons and Checkboxes by Default**
- 11/20/19 - No questions or comments.

**Nest Many Elements within a Single div Element**
- 11/20/19 - Divs are important as you start layering
  CSS and JavaScript to target specific elements, and 
  organize the page.

**Declare the Doctype of an HTML Document**
- 11/20/19 - No questions or comments.

**Define the Head and Body of an HTML Document**
- 11/20/19 - No questions or comments.

### Introduction to Basic CSS
**Change the Color of Text**
- 11/22/19 - No questions.  Quick comment, other
courses emphasis to not use inline style attributes
and instead use a separate CSS file.  In practice,
are inline style tags used at all?

**Use CSS Selectors to Style Elements**
- 11/22/19 - same comment as above.  A separate style
section cleans up the code a bit, but not practical for
a lot of styling.  Perhaps for a small static site.

**Use a CSS Class to Style an Element**
- 11/22/19 - Building towards using a separate css file
using class names to apply a style.  Always have to 
remind myself that '.' denotes a class and '#' denotes
and id.

**Style Multiple Elements with a CSS Class**
- 11/22/19 - Shows how powerful and flexible CSS is when
combined with classes.

**Change the Font Size of an Element**
- 11/22/19 - No questons or comments.

**Set the Font Family of an Element**
- 11/22/19 - Googled standard OS fonts and found this:

**Side note - love todays quote on freecodecamp**
If you can't fly then run, if you can't run then walk, 
if you can't walk then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward.
