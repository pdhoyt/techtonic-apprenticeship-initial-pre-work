**Add Images to Your Website**

  another place in the same document.

**Nest an Anchor Element within a Paragraph**
- 11/20/19 - Good reminder regarding target=_blank attribute,
  to open the linked URL in a new tab.  Wondering if that 
  works with an internal section link?  No sure if there's 
  a valid use case, but worth experimenting with.

**Make Dead Links Using the Hash Symbol**
- 11/20/19 - Interested in the comment "This is also handy when 
  you're changing the behavior of a link using JavaScript, which

  Script training and haven't run accross where href="#" is
  used.

  learning that piece.

  is not sent.
