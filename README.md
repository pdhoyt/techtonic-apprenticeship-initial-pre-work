**Introduction to HTML5 ElementsPassed**
- 11/20/19 - No concerns - would be interesting to research 
  how SEO's use <MAIN> to optimize search results.  Topic for
  another day!

**Add Images to Your Website**
- 11/20/19 - No concerns.  Is it generally better to host the
  image files vs. using URLs to external images, from a performace
  perspective?

**Link to External Pages with Anchor Elements**
-11/20/19 - No questions or concerns

**Link to Internal Sections of a Page with Anchor Elements**
- 11/20/19 - New material to me, using an ID to point to
  another place in the same document.

**Nest an Anchor Element within a Paragraph**
- 11/20/19 - Good reminder regarding target=_blank attribute,
  to open the linked URL in a new tab.  Wondering if that 
  works with an internal section link?  No sure if there's 
  a valid use case, but worth experimenting with.

**Make Dead Links Using the Hash Symbol**
- 11/20/19 - Interested in the comment "This is also handy when 
  you're changing the behavior of a link using JavaScript, which 
  we'll learn about later."  I've taken some preliminary Java-
  Script training and haven't run accross where href="#" is
  used.

**Turn an Image into a Link**
- 11/20/19 - Is this still common? 
  Seems like images aren't really used for links anymore.

**Create a Bulleted Unordered List**
- 11/20/19 - No questions or comments.

**Create an Ordered List**

**Add Placeholder Text to a Text Field**
- 11/20/19 - No questions or comments.

**Create a Form Element**
- 11/20/19 - No questions - forms get trickier when
  you have to create routes and interact with databases.  Still
  learning that piece.

**Add a Submit Button to a Form**
- 11/20/19 - No questions.  Input type=submit creates a 
  button as well.  Need to refresh my memory on how they
  differ.

**Use HTML5 to Require a Field**
-  11/20/19 - No questions or comments.

**Create a Set of Radio Buttons** 
- 11/20/19 - No questions or comments.

**Create a Set of Checkboxes**
- 11/20/19 - No questions or comments.

**Use the value attribute with Radio Buttons and Checkboxes**
- 11/20/19 - Great information on the 'Value' attribute, and 
  why it needs to be set on all form items, so the default value
  is not sent.

**Check Radio Buttons and Checkboxes by Default**
- 11/20/19 - No questions or comments.

**Nest Many Elements within a Single div Element**
- 11/20/19 - Divs are important as you start layering
  CSS and JavaScript to target specific elements, and 
  organize the page.

**Declare the Doctype of an HTML Document**
- 11/20/19 - No questions or comments.

**Define the Head and Body of an HTML Document**
- 11/20/19 - No questions or comments.

### Introduction to Basic CSS
**Change the Color of Text**
- 11/22/19 - No questions.  Quick comment, other
courses emphasis to not use inline style attributes
and instead use a separate CSS file.  In practice,
are inline style tags used at all?

**Use CSS Selectors to Style Elements**
- 11/22/19 - same comment as above.  A separate style
section cleans up the code a bit, but not practical for
a lot of styling.  Perhaps for a small static site.

**Use a CSS Class to Style an Element**
- 11/22/19 - Building towards using a separate css file
using class names to apply a style.  Always have to 
remind myself that '.' denotes a class and '#' denotes
and id.

**Style Multiple Elements with a CSS Class**
- 11/22/19 - Shows how powerful and flexible CSS is when
combined with classes.

**Change the Font Size of an Element**
- 11/22/19 - No questons or comments.

**Set the Font Family of an Element**
- 11/22/19 - Googled standard OS fonts and found this:
  https://www.granneman.com/webdev/coding/css/fonts-and-formatting/default-fonts

**Side note - love todays quote on freecodecamp**
  If you can't fly then run, if you can't run then walk, 
  if you can't walk then crawl, but whatever you do you 
  have to keep moving forward.
  Martin Luther King Jr.

**Import a Google Font**
- 11/22/19 - Was curious if there were other free sources of 
  fonts and found this:
  https://blog.prototypr.io/top-10-resources-for-great-web-fonts-2355121f1273

**Specify How Fonts Should Degrade**
- 11/22/19 - Noticed that the google font worked with and 
  without "" in the style tag.

**Size Your Images**
- 11/22/19 - Triggered a question re: proper order of html tag attributes,
there isn't really one per stack overflow:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2720618/valid-order-for-attributes-of-input-type-tag/2720645

**Add Borders Around Your Elements**
- 11/22/19 - Used "border: 10px green solid"; instead.

**Add Rounded Corners with border-radius**
- 11/22/19 - No questions or comments.

**Make Circular Images with a border-radiusPassed**
- 11/22/19 - No questions or comments.

**Give a Background Color to a div Element**
- 11/22/19 - No questions - divs were a mystery at first, but
  when CSS and JavaScript are added to the mix, they make a lot of
  sense as containers for elements.

**Set the id of an Element**
- 11/22/19 - No questions or comments.

**Adjust the Padding of an Element**
- 11/22/19 - No questions or comments.

**Adjust the Margin of an ElementPassed**
- 11/22/19 - No questions or comments.

**Add a Negative Margin to an Element**
- 11/22/19 - This was new information to me, I didn't realize that
  setting a margin to a negative would increase the size of the
  element.  Interesting - will try and think of some use cases.

**Add Different Padding to Each Side of an Element**
- 11/22/19 - No questions or comments.

**Add Different Margins to Each Side of an Element**
- 11/22/19 - No questions or comments.

**Use Clockwise Notation to Specify the Padding of an Element**
- 11/22/19 - No questions or comments.

**Use Clockwise Notation to Specify the Margin of an Element**
- 11/22/19 - No questions or comments.

**Use Attribute Selectors to Style Elements**
- 11/22/19 - Don't think I've seen this before.  Cool that
  you can use attributes & values to style elements.  Is
  there a benefit to using this vs. Id or Class? or is it
  personal preference?

**Understand Absolute versus Relative UnitsPassed**
- 11/22/19 - Good information.  Didn't realize that 'em' only
  relates to fonts and font size, and is relative to the parent
  element font.  Confusing to me that the exercise uses em on 
  padding, when the notes say its a font-based property?
  Looking forward to 'rem' discussion/lesson in
  Responsive Web Design Principles' section.

**Style the HTML Body Element**
- 11/22/19 - No questions or comments.

**Inherit Styles from the Body Element**
- 11/22/19 - No questions or comments.

**Prioritize One Style Over Another**
- 11/22/19 - Good introduction to specificity.

**Override Styles in Subsequent CSS**
- 11/22/19 - Good to know that the class order within the element
  doesn't matter.  Just that the last one declared in the style tag
  wins.

**Override Class Declarations by Styling ID Attributes**
- 11/22/19 - in specificity hierarchy - id wins over class.

**Override Class Declarations with Inline Styles**
- 11/22/19 - inline styles win over id.

**Override All Other Styles by using ImportantPassed**
- 11/22/19 - No questions or comments.

**Use Hex Code for Specific Colors**
- 11/22/19 - Good quick overview of base 16 (hexidecimal) numbers.  
  Lots of cool hex color resources out there:
  https://www.hexcolortool.com/

**Use Hex Code to Mix Colors**
- 1/22/19 - No questions or comments.

**Use Abbreviated Hex Code**
- 1/22/19 - No questions or comments.

**Use RGB values to Color Elements**
- 11/22/19 - Is it developer preference when it comes to Hex, RGB, or
  color name?

**Use RGB to Mix Colors**
- 11/22/19 - No questions or comments.

**Use CSS Variables to change several elements at once**
- 11/22/19 - No questions or comments.

**Create a custom CSS Variable**
- 11/22/19 - the '--' syntax for custom CSS variables was new
  material for me.

**Use a custom CSS Variable**
- 11/22/19 - Failed on first submit on this, didn't use the 
  var(--penguin-skin) sytax (left out 'var').

**Attach a Fallback value to a CSS Variable**
- 11/22/19 - No questions or comments.

**Improve Compatibility with Browser Fallbacks**
- 11/22/19 - Good to know.  Why does it seem like Internet
  Explorer is always the least compatible browser :)

**Inherit CSS Variables**
- 11/22/19 - Wasn't familiar with the inheritance within CSS 
  or the :root psuedo-class.  Good information, but not enough
  information about :root, and how/when its used.

**Change a variable for a specific area**
- 11/22/19 - No questions or comments - lots to learn!

**Use a media query to change a variable**
- 11/22/19 - An odd way to introduce the term 'Media Query'
  I think it would leave the novice (including me) wondering
  what a media query was.  I've since learned more about them
  in regards to responsive web design.

### Introduction to the CSS Flexbox Challenges

**Use display: flex to Position Two Boxes**
- 11/22/19 - No questions or comments - yet.

**Add Flex Superpowers to the Tweet EmbedPassed**
- 11/22/19 - No questions or comments.

**Use the flex-direction Property to Make a RowPassed**
- 11/22/19 - No questions or comments.

**Apply the flex-direction Property to Create Rows in the Tweet Embed**
- 11/22/19 - Didn't notice big changes to the display after
  running this test.

**Use the flex-direction Property to Make a Column**
- 11/22/19 - used column property to stack boxes vertically.

**Apply the flex-direction Property to Create a Column in the Tweet Embed**
- 11/22/19 - applied column property to tweet example.

**Align Elements Using the justify-content Property**
- 11/22/19 - liked the image, helps solidify the flex concepts:
  https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/images/flex-direction-terms.svg
  Lots of material in this particular lesson.  Adding a bookmark to it
  for future reference.  I've battled a bit with alignmnent, especially 
  aligning elements vertically within a container.  This should help.

**Use the justify-content Property in the Tweet Embed**
- 11/22/19 - No questions or comments.

**Align Elements Using the align-items Property**
- 11/22/19 - good to remember that justify-content works on main axis,
  while align-items works on cross-axis.

**Use the align-items Property in the Tweet Embed**
- 11/22/19 - No questions or comments.

**Use the flex-wrap Property to Wrap a Row or Column**
- 11/22/19 - Will take some practice to 'wrap' my head around this 
  concept....(sorry!).  I assume with the default setting of no wrap, 
  new items added to the container will get smaller and smaller as 
  they fill it up.

**Use the flex-shrink Property to Shrink Items**
- 11/22/19 - Addresses my question above - sort of.  The number system
  within flex-shrink lets individual items shrink in different proportions.

**Use the flex-grow Property to Expand Items**
- 11/22/19 - While the flex-shrink property only kicks in when the 
  parent container fills up or shrinks, the flex-grow property
  activates when the container expands.

**Use the flex-basis Property to Set the Initial Size of an Item**
- 11/22/19 - Not clear here if flex basis (which sets the initial size)
  and flex-shrink or flex-grow, can or should all be included in the
  page styling?  Experimented a bit - and looks like they can all work
  in tandem to customize display of elements at various container sizes.

**Use the flex Shorthand Property**
- 11/22/19 - kind of answers my questions from the previous lesson.

**Use the order Property to Rearrange Items**
- 11/22/19 - with just two elements, the order property has the same
  effect as 'row-reverse' or 'column-reverse' of flex-direction property.
  although, that is set on the container vs. the element within the
  container.

**Use the align-self Property**
- 11/22/19 - Allows individual elements within a container to have unique
  alignment properties.

### CSS Grid Challenges

**Create Your First CSS Grid**
- 11/25/19 - No questions or comments.

**Add Columns with grid-template-columns**
- 11/25/19 - No questions or comments.

**Add Rows with grid-template-rows**
- 11/25/19 - No questions or comments.

**Use CSS Grid units to Change the Size of Columns and Rows**
- 11/25/19 - First time I've seen the 'fr' to set a column or row    to a fraction of the available space.  Also interesting that in    a single command, you can combine auto, px, % and fr, as in the    example - "grid-template-columns: auto 50px 10% 2fr 1fr".  Makes   grids very flexible and a little confusing.

**Create a Column Gap Using grid-column-gap**
- 11/25/19 - With grid-column-gap present, I assume that the fr      and % settings for columns - the gap is included in the            calculation automatically.  BTW - VS code pointed out that         grid-column-gap property is obsolete - replaced by column-gap.     Also, noticed that '%' works as well, although not clear if 'fr'   or 'auto' work.

**Create a Row Gap using grid-row-gap**
- 11/25/19 - same comments/observations as with column-gap.

**Add Gaps Faster with grid-gap**
- 11/25/19 - Nice shortcut, that accepts a single value, or two      values, first for rows, second for columns.  Sounds like this      property has been replaced by 'gap' but still works, like the      others.

**Use grid-column to Control Spacing**
- 11/25/19 - Not clear to me on this one why 'grid-column: 2/4'      works on a 3 x 2 grid.

**Use grid-row to Control Spacing**
- 11/25/19 - same comment - doesn't make sense.  Need to do some     additional reading on this one.

**Align an Item Horizontally using justify-self**
- 11/25/19 - No questions or comments.

**Align an Item Vertically using align-self**
- 11/25/19 - No questions or comments.

**Align All Items Horizontally using justify-items**
- 11/25/19 - Setting on the container element when all items will    have the same justification.

**Align All Items Vertically using align-items**
- 11/25/19 - Setting on the container element when all items will    have the same alignment.

**Divide the Grid Into an Area Template**
- 11/25/19 - So this groups cells together, but on its own,          doesn't impact how the grid appears in html?

**Place Items in Grid Areas Using the grid-area Property**
- 11/25/19 - Assign items to a grid area defined in previous         section.  Answers my question in the previous lesson.  Template    has to be called using the grid-area property.

**Use grid-area Without Creating an Areas Template**
- 11/25/19 - Like the grid-column/row properties using numbers,      this is confusing to me.  Prefer the area-template property.       Had to request the hint on this: The grid-area takes values in     the following format horizontal line to start at / vertical line   to start at / horizontal line to end at / vertical line to end     at.

**Reduce Repetition Using the repeat Function**
- 11/25/19 - Easy way to replicate columns and rows with the same    properties.  Does would this interact with the HTML table          element?  Are they mutually exclusive options?

**Limit Item Size Using the minmax Function**
- 11/25/19 - No questions or comments.

**Create Flexible Layouts Using auto-fill**
- 11/25/19 - Another confusing setting - need to play around with various sizes of elements to better   understand how this works.

**Create Flexible Layouts Using auto-fit**
- 11/25/19 - This example made more sense - the difference between auto-fill and auto-fit.

**Use Media Queries to Create Responsive Layouts**
- 11/25/19 - Interested that there can be multiple media queries within the same     html document, triggered at different screen sizes.

**Create Grids within Grids**
- 11/25/19 - No questions or comments - other than its going to take a while and     some practice for this to sink in well.  Looks like there is some debate on        which is better CSS Grid vs Flexbox.  Is there an industry standard or general     preference?
