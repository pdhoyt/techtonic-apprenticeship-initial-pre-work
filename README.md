**Delete HTML Elements**

**Introduction to HTML5 ElementsPassed**
- 11/20/19 - No concerns - would be interesting to research 
  how SEO's use <MAIN> to optimize search results.  Topic for
  another day!

**Add Images to Your Website**
- 11/20/19 - No concerns.  Is it generally better to host the
  image files vs. using URLs to external images, from a performace
  perspective?

**Link to External Pages with Anchor Elements**
-11/20/19 - No questions or concerns

**Link to Internal Sections of a Page with Anchor Elements**
- 11/20/19 - New material to me, using an ID to point to
  another place in the same document.

**Nest an Anchor Element within a Paragraph**
- 11/20/19 - Good reminder regarding target=_blank attribute,
  to open the linked URL in a new tab.  Wondering if that 
  works with an internal section link?  No sure if there's 
  a valid use case, but worth experimenting with.

**Make Dead Links Using the Hash Symbol**
- 11/20/19 - Interested in the comment "This is also handy when 
  you're changing the behavior of a link using JavaScript, which 
  we'll learn about later."  I've taken some preliminary Java-
  Script training and haven't run accross where href="#" is
  used.

**Turn an Image into a Link**
- 11/20/19 - Is this still common? 
  Seems like images aren't really used for links anymore.

**Create a Bulleted Unordered List**
- 11/20/19 - No questions or comments.

**Create an Ordered List**

**Add Placeholder Text to a Text Field**
- 11/20/19 - No questions or comments.

**Create a Form Element**
- 11/20/19 - No questions - forms get trickier when
  you have to create routes and interact with databases.  Still
  learning that piece.

**Add a Submit Button to a Form**
- 11/20/19 - No questions.  Input type=submit creates a 
  button as well.  Need to refresh my memory on how they
  differ.

**Use HTML5 to Require a Field**
-  11/20/19 - No questions or comments.

**Create a Set of Radio Buttons** 
- 11/20/19 - No questions or comments.

**Create a Set of Checkboxes**
- 11/20/19 - No questions or comments.

**Use the value attribute with Radio Buttons and Checkboxes**
- 11/20/19 - Great information on the 'Value' attribute, and 
  why it needs to be set on all form items, so the default value
  is not sent.

**Check Radio Buttons and Checkboxes by Default**
- 11/20/19 - No questions or comments.

**Nest Many Elements within a Single div Element**
- 11/20/19 - Divs are important as you start layering
  CSS and JavaScript to target specific elements, and 
  organize the page.

**Declare the Doctype of an HTML Document**
- 11/20/19 - No questions or comments.

**Define the Head and Body of an HTML Document**
- 11/20/19 - No questions or comments.

### Introduction to Basic CSS
**Change the Color of Text**
- 11/22/19 - No questions.  Quick comment, other
courses emphasis to not use inline style attributes
and instead use a separate CSS file.  In practice,
are inline style tags used at all?

**Use CSS Selectors to Style Elements**
- 11/22/19 - same comment as above.  A separate style
section cleans up the code a bit, but not practical for
a lot of styling.  Perhaps for a small static site.

**Use a CSS Class to Style an Element**
- 11/22/19 - Building towards using a separate css file
using class names to apply a style.  Always have to 
remind myself that '.' denotes a class and '#' denotes
and id.

**Style Multiple Elements with a CSS Class**
- 11/22/19 - Shows how powerful and flexible CSS is when
combined with classes.

**Change the Font Size of an Element**
- 11/22/19 - No questons or comments.

**Set the Font Family of an Element**
- 11/22/19 - Googled standard OS fonts and found this:
  https://www.granneman.com/webdev/coding/css/fonts-and-formatting/default-fonts

**Side note - love todays quote on freecodecamp**
  If you can't fly then run, if you can't run then walk, 
  if you can't walk then crawl, but whatever you do you 
  have to keep moving forward.
  Martin Luther King Jr.

**Import a Google Font**
- 11/22/19 - Was curious if there were other free sources of 
  fonts and found this:
  https://blog.prototypr.io/top-10-resources-for-great-web-fonts-2355121f1273

**Specify How Fonts Should Degrade**
- 11/22/19 - Noticed that the google font worked with and 
  without "" in the style tag.

**Size Your Images**
- 11/22/19 - Triggered a question re: proper order of html tag attributes,
there isn't really one per stack overflow:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2720618/valid-order-for-attributes-of-input-type-tag/2720645

**Add Borders Around Your Elements**
- 11/22/19 - Used "border: 10px green solid"; instead.

**Add Rounded Corners with border-radius**
- 11/22/19 - No questions or comments.

**Make Circular Images with a border-radiusPassed**
- 11/22/19 - No questions or comments.

**Give a Background Color to a div Element**
- 11/22/19 - No questions - divs were a mystery at first, but
  when CSS and JavaScript are added to the mix, they make a lot of
  sense as containers for elements.

**Set the id of an Element**
- 11/22/19 - No questions or comments.

**Adjust the Padding of an Element**
- 11/22/19 - No questions or comments.

**Adjust the Margin of an ElementPassed**
- 11/22/19 - No questions or comments.

**Add a Negative Margin to an Element**
- 11/22/19 - This was new information to me, I didn't realize that
  setting a margin to a negative would increase the size of the
  element.  Interesting - will try and think of some use cases.

**Add Different Padding to Each Side of an Element**
- 11/22/19 - No questions or comments.

**Add Different Margins to Each Side of an Element**
- 11/22/19 - No questions or comments.

**Use Clockwise Notation to Specify the Padding of an Element**
- 11/22/19 - No questions or comments.

**Use Clockwise Notation to Specify the Margin of an Element**
- 11/22/19 - No questions or comments.

**Use Attribute Selectors to Style Elements**
- 11/22/19 - Don't think I've seen this before.  Cool that
  you can use attributes & values to style elements.  Is
  there a benefit to using this vs. Id or Class? or is it
  personal preference?

**Understand Absolute versus Relative UnitsPassed**
- 11/22/19 - Good information.  Didn't realize that 'em' only
  relates to fonts and font size, and is relative to the parent
  element font.  Confusing to me that the exercise uses em on 
  padding, when the notes say its a font-based property?
  Looking forward to 'rem' discussion/lesson in
  Responsive Web Design Principles' section.

**Style the HTML Body Element**
- 11/22/19 - No questions or comments.

**Inherit Styles from the Body Element**
- 11/22/19 - No questions or comments.

**Prioritize One Style Over Another**
- 11/22/19 - Good introduction to specificity.

**Override Styles in Subsequent CSS**
- 11/22/19 - Good to know that the class order within the element
  doesn't matter.  Just that the last one declared in the style tag
  wins.

**Override Class Declarations by Styling ID Attributes**
- 11/22/19 - in specificity hierarchy - id wins over class.

**Override Class Declarations with Inline Styles**
- 11/22/19 - inline styles win over id.

**Override All Other Styles by using ImportantPassed**
- 11/22/19 - No questions or comments.

**Use Hex Code for Specific Colors**
- 11/22/19 - Good quick overview of base 16 (hexidecimal) numbers.  
  Lots of cool hex color resources out there:
  https://www.hexcolortool.com/

**Use Hex Code to Mix Colors**
- 1/22/19 - No questions or comments.

**Use Abbreviated Hex Code**
- 1/22/19 - No questions or comments.

**Use RGB values to Color Elements**
- 11/22/19 - Is it developer preference when it comes to Hex, RGB, or
  color name?

**Use RGB to Mix Colors**
- 11/22/19 - No questions or comments.

**Use CSS Variables to change several elements at once**
- 11/22/19 - No questions or comments.

**Create a custom CSS Variable**
- 11/22/19 - the '--' syntax for custom CSS variables was new
  material for me.

**Use a custom CSS Variable**
- 11/22/19 - Failed on first submit on this, didn't use the 
  var(--penguin-skin) sytax (left out 'var').

**Attach a Fallback value to a CSS Variable**
- 11/22/19 - No questions or comments.

**Improve Compatibility with Browser Fallbacks**
- 11/22/19 - Good to know.  Why does it seem like Internet
  Explorer is always the least compatible browser :)

**Inherit CSS Variables**
- 11/22/19 - Wasn't familiar with the inheritance within CSS 
  or the :root psuedo-class.  Good information, but not enough
  information about :root, and how/when its used.

**Change a variable for a specific area**
- 11/22/19 - No questions or comments - lots to learn!

**Use a media query to change a variable**
- 11/21/19 - An odd way to introduce the term 'Media Query'
  I think it would leave the novice (including me) wondering
  what a media query was.  I've since learned more about them
  in regards to responsive web design.
