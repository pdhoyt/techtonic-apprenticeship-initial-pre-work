### Introduction to Basic HTML and HTML5
**Say Hello to HTML Elements**
- No issues or problems with this lesson - 11/19/19 - PDH
Quick question though, I've gone through the freecodecamp 
'Basic HTML and HTML5' (all 28 lessons), 'Basic CSS' 
(all 44 lessons), and 14 of the 52 Applied Visual Design
lessons.  Do you recommend/require that I re-do all these
lessons, or can I share my progress with you.  Also, should 
we be pasting any code into the readme, or anywhere else, to
push to github?
